# Timer

This is a lightweight time tracking app. It uses very little memory. It shows you how long you have been working in decimal format on the top menubar. You can pick categories such as Development, I.T. Support and Personal. It has the ability to add notes to describe the task you are working on. It also saves your entries and exports into a csv file.
